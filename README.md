## Details

### Webmanifest
Parcel is not able to pick `manifest.json`, instead it parses:
```html
<link rel="manifest" href="manifest.webmanifest">
```

### Service Worker
The `dist/service-worker.js` file is generated by the Workbox library based on the `workbox-config.js` config file. In order to generate the list of files to cache, first workbox needs parcel to produce those files.

We have a chicken and egg problem because parcel picks up the service worker file by looking its registration in the source code:
https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/pull/398

To solve this problem we give parcel an empty service worker file: `src/service-worker.js`. When running `npm run build`, parcel copies that file to the `dist` directory then the post hook `postbuild` is triggered and workbox replaces the empty service worker with the real one.

### SPA routing and caching
When refreshing a page like `/users`, as opposed to the root `/`, while offline, the service worker bails out. Which is logic since it only knows what was produced in the `dist` directory.

To circumvent that problem, workbox as our back, just set:
```
"navigateFallback": "/index.html"
```
in the workbox config file.
